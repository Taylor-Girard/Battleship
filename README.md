This is a short battleship game I made the summer after my first year of my computer science degree. This was made after I had learned the basics of programming, but before I had a lot of practical experience with object-oriented programming. Therefore, it was kind of a challenge to myself to make this only being taught conditional statements, loops, and functions. 

The game allows the user to play a game of battleship against a semi-intelligent computer. Due to a lack of time to test more possibilities of games, there may be some instances where the computer gets stuck and breaks the game that I have not caught. However, in most instances the game seems to be able to be finished (although the player will almost always win).

Here are some photos of the game in action:
