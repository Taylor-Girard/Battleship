This is a short battleship game I made the summer after my first year of my computer science degree. This was made after I had learned the basics of programming, but before I had a lot of practical experience with object-oriented programming. Therefore, it was kind of a challenge to myself to make this only being taught conditional statements, loops, and functions. 

The game allows the user to play a game of battleship against a semi-intelligent computer. Due to a lack of time to test more possibilities of games, there may be some instances where the computer gets stuck and breaks the game that I have not caught. However, in most instances the game seems to be able to be finished (although the player will almost always win). There is also less of a likelihood for the computer to pick places on the edges, but it can be upgraded using the random() method. I kept it that way beacause I feel like the computer not choosing edge pieces could be seen as more strategic, as I feel like it better emulates how a human would play.

Here are some photos of the game in action:
